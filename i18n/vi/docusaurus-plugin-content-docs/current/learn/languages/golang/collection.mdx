# Collection

## Array

An array in Go is a fixed sized entity. All elements in an array must have same type.

```go
var arr [3]int
arr[0] = 1
arr[1] = 2
arr[2] = 3
fmt.Println(arr)

arr2 := [3]int{1, 2, 3}
fmt.Println(arr2)
```

## Slice

Slice is built on top of array. It is like array, but *dynamically sized* and offer up a lot of really *neat attributes* <- **used more than array**

```go
arr2 := [3]int{1, 2, 3}
slice := arr[:] // [:] means from start to end
````

## Map

Key-value relationship.

## Struct

Go doesn't have class, but it has `struct`.
