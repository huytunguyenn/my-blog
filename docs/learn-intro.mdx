# Preface

This is where I take notes of what I've learnt all over the way.

Learning has always been my favorite part for the journey. So, I write stuffs. *(and I want to improve my writing skills as well, you may see some places I make wrong grammar tee-hee :p)*

I wrote these while researching for knowledge from the Internet. So it may easy for me to sometimes forget to include the resources, but I'll try to mention the references as much as possible.

Therefore, as many wise said,

happy learning.
