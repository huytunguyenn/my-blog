# Notes for Leetcode

*Some code snippets that I concluded so that I can do Leetcode faster.*

## Built-in functions

Python has many things that has built up for us. Why not using them?

### Max, min

Use `max`, `min` for faster finding:

```python
current_max = max(current_max, array[i])
current_min = min(current_min, array[i])
```

### Sorting

Use `sort` to sort array (mutable). The complexity is usually $O(nlogn)$.

```python
arr.sort()
```

Use `sorted` for immutable:

```python
sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
```

### Using lambda

Lambda function is an anonymous function with 1 expression. You can prefer something like `(x) => x + 1` in JavaScript for example.

```python
x = lambda a : a + 10
print(x(5)) # 15
```

You can use lambda function with `map`, `filter`, etc.

*Note that `map` returns map object so we have to convert it to array using `list()`*

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list(map(lambda n: n * 2, arr))

# highlight
> [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

We can use that for addition of arrays.  For example, we want [1, 2, 1, 0] plus [0, 1, 2, 1] like this:

```
 1 2 1 0
 0 1 2 1
 1 3 3 1 <-
```

Simply add is not going to work:

```python
arr = [1, 2, 1, 0] + [0, 1, 2, 1]

# highlight
> arr: [1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1]
```

So we use **lambda function** with `map()` and `list()`:

```python

```

## Array tips

### Declare 2-dimension array

Instead of:

```python
2d_arr = [0] * rows
for i in range(rows):
  res[i] = [0] * cols

# highlight-start
# for example with rows = 3, cols = 4:
[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
# highlight-end
```

Do these:

```python
2d_arr = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
```

*Note that we don't use* `arr = [] * n`*, cause this is not create anything. So we had to have initial value for array.*

### Declare

When we do things related to 2-D array, remember divide (`//`) and module (`%`).

## Data structures

### Counter

When counter problems that requires counting elements repeat, etc. Example is the problem that ask for repeat of each character in a string.

We can use `Counter` from `collections` library, this data structure creates a dictionary that has element is **key**, **value** is `count` variable.

```python
from collections import Counter

# create dictionary stores <objects,counts> as <key,value>
cnt = Counter('hello world')

cnt['o']  # 2, count of character 'c'
cnt['o'] += 1
```

## Input, output

In some platforms like Codeforces or UVA, sometimes reading input is complicated if you're not familiar with it.

### Read integer input

Read an integer in a line:

```python
n = int(input())
```

Read many integers in a line:

```python
# highlight
9, 10

na,nb = map(int, input().split())

# highlight
> na: 9, nb: 10
```

Read many lines into an array, use `list(map(int, input().split()))`:

```python
# highlight-start
2 4
5 6
# highlight-end

a = []
for i in range(2):
  a.extend(list(map(int,input().split())))

# highlight
> a: [2, 4, 5, 6]
```
