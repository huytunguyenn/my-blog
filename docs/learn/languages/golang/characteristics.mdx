# Overview

Some of Go characteristics.

## Characteristics

Go has a strong, static type system, better when compare to scripting languages such as JavaScript or Python.

Go is inspired by C's syntax.

Go is multi-paradigm programming language, a mixture of **procedural** and **object-oriented**.

Go is **garbage collected** language.

Go is fully compiled. Unlike *scripting languages* (which are interpreted at runtime) or languages that are compiled to some intermediate code that are interpreted by a runtime (such as Java)
- Go applications are fully compiled down to an executable binary -> highest levels of performance possible
- Single binary output -> simple deployment

Go has rapid compilation -> better when doing TDD methodology

## Philosophy and value

### Simplicity

For example:
- All loops in Go are **for-loops**
- Go doesn't make **expressions**, it is **statements** *(it evaluates all as 1 unit, whereas expression is a component of statement)*. For example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="code-1" label="There are some expressions">

    i := 1
    println(i++) // sometimes you may confuse
    println(++i)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="code-2" label="It's all statement">

    i := 1
    i++
    println(i) // 2, obviously
    i++
    println(i) // 3

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Network aware & concurrent apps

Unlike other languages, Go was created after CPUs have multiple core and were able to run tasks concurrently -> Go adotped those designs

net and net/http packages: create web servers using only standard library

goroutines: start lots of concurrent tasks with minimal resources

channels: safely communicate between concurrent tasks

### Out-of-the-box experience

Standard library: string manipulation, data compression, file manipulation, networking APIS, testing, etc.

Go CLI: project initialization, build, code generation, retrieve dependencies, test, profiling, documentation, etc.


### Cross-platform

- Windows
    - GOOS = windows
    - GOARCH = amd64
- OS X
    - GOOS = darwin
    - GOARCH = amd64
- Android

### Backward compatibility


## Primary use cases
