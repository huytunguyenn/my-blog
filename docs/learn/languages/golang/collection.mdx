# Collection

## Array

An array in Go is a fixed sized entity. All elements in an array must have same type.

```go
// long way
var arr [3]int
arr[0] = 1
arr[1] = 2
arr[2] = 3

// short way
arr := [3]int{1, 2, 3}


// highlight
> [1 2 3]
```

## Slice

Slice is built on top of array. It is like array, but *dynamically sized* and offer up a lot of really *neat attributes* <- **used more than array**

Therefore, you can create slice from array by using `[start:end]`.

```go
arr := [3]int{1, 2, 3}
slice := arr[:] // [:] means from start to end
```

Slice is kind of pointer, not really, but it is pointing to underlying array. Change `arr` will change `slice` as well.

```go
arr[1] = 42
slice[2] = 27


// highlight-start
> arr: [1 42 27]
> slice: [1 42 27]
// highlight-end
```

Otherwise, create a new slice:

```go
slice := []int{1, 2, 3}
```

Using `append(slice, elements...)` to add new `elements` to `slice`.

```go
slice = append(slice, 4, 5, 6)


// highlight
> slice: [1 2 3 4 5 6]
```

Just like create slice from array, we can also create sub slices from slice using `[start:end]`

```go
s2 := slice[1:]
s3 := slice[:2]
s4 := slice[1:2]


// highlight-start
> s2: [2 3 4 5 6]
> s3: [1 2]
> s4: [2]
// highlight-end
```

## Map

Map represents key-value relationship. To create map, use `map` keyword.

```go
m := map[string]int{ "foo" : 42 }


// highlight-start
> m: map[foo:42]
> m["foo"]: 42
// highlight-end
```

All the keys had to be the same type, same with all the values.

```go
m["foo"] = 27
// -error
m["foo"] = "bar" // error: (type string) cannot be represented by the type int
```

You can delete a pair using `delete(map, key)`.

```go
delete(m, "foo")


// highlight
> m: map[]
```

## Struct

Go doesn't have class, but it has `struct`.

This is the only collection type that allows **associate disparate data types together**.

In `struct`, field is fixed at compile time. To declare a `struct`:

```go
type user struct {
  ID        int
  FirstName string
  LastName  string
}
```

To add the value to field:

```go
var u user


// highlight
> u: {0  } // struct initialized with 0 value (0 in int is 0, 0 in string in blank)
```

```go
u.ID = 1
u.FirstName = "Huy"
u.LastName = "Tu"


// highlight
> u: {1 Huy Tu}
```

Note that the fields are fixed at compile time, means it cannot be dynamically added or removed.

There's also an implicit way to declare `struct`:

```go
u := user{ID: 1, FirstName: "Huy", LastName: "Tu"}


// highlight
> u: {1 Huy Tu}
```

:::caution

If you use multiple lines declaration, you will need to **add a comma at the end**.

Below declaration will get error:

```go
u := user{ ID: 1,
  FirstName: "Huy",
  // -error
  LastName: "Tu" // error: Need a trailing comma before a newline in the composite literal
}
```
