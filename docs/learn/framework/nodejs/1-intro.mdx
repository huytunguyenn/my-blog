# Introduction

## What

Node.js is an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, Node is designed to build scalable network applications.

Commonly known as server-side JavaScript *(in fact, the execution of JavaScript on the server is done with a virtual machine (V8/Chakra), Node is like a coordinator, a wrapper)*.

But it is used more than that, it has:
- many built-in modules (fs, http, crypto, zip, ...)
- provides asynchronous APIs (without needing to deal with threads) $\rightarrow$ biggest benefit
- C++ addons

## Why

- **APIs and microservices**

  More "lightweight" alternative for application server style deployment model: there's no server to deploy your code to, your code is the server
  $\rightarrow$ easier to build increasingly complex application.
  ```javascript
  const http = require('http');

  const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
  const port = 3000;

  const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('Hello World');
  });

  server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
  });
  ```
- **Serverless cloud functions**

  As a dynamic language runtime with a fast startup & low memory consumption.
- **Command line applications**

  `webpack`, `gulp`, `ESLint`, `Yeoman`, etc. written in JavaScript and run in Node.js.
- **Desktop applications**

  Due to `Electron` framework. For e.g. `Skype`, `Github Desktop`, `Visual Studio Code`, `Slack`, `Atom`, `Hyper`, etc.

## How

### History

### Node Clusters

Read more about [we should let a Node process to crash and exit](/learn/framework/nodejs/5-modules.mdx#errors--exceptions).

Like its name, Node is actually nodes. In production, server runs cluster of node processes. With many-cores CPU, each node process is running for each core. One working process exiting should not mean the system is down.

There will be cluster have a master process, which should be monitoring worker processes. And it starts the new one when the process crashes and exits.

There are tools like `PM2` that wrap the cluster [module](/learn/framework/nodejs/5-modules.mdx) to run your Node application in production.

## Why Not To

- **CPU-intensive tasks**

  Node is designed to build scalable network app, "network" implies "I/O" $\rightarrow$ required heavy use of CPU, better for I/O-intensive use cases
- **Dynamic typed nature of JavaScript**
