# Go Characteristics

Strong, static type system ( > JavaScript / Python )

C-inspired syntax

Go is multi-paradigm programming language, mixture of:
- Procedural
- Object oriented

Go is a garbage collected language

Fully compiled:
- Unlike scripting languages, which are interpreted at runtime. Or Java that are compiled to some intermediate code that are interpreted by a runtime
- Go applications are fully compiled down to an executable binary -> highest levels of performance possible
- Single binary output -> simple deployment

Rapid compilation -> important when doing TDD
