Some advanced things

## Pipes & direction

`|` is called pipe symbol.

`ls | less`: take output from `ls` and send it to input of `less`. So that you can easily browse through file list.

`grep string file`: search for *string* in *file* and print only those lines.

**Some examples**

Let say I have a csv file that includes details of films that nominated Oscars:

1. I want extract all the films that are in 1978 in order.
- First I find all the lines that has "1978": `grep 1978 oscars.tsv`
- Then I continue to sort: `grep 1978 oscars.tsv | sort`
- Then I want to save it to another file: `grap 1978 oscars.tsv | sort > 1978films.txt`

2. I want to know how many films received 4 Oscars. Suppose 3rd column is number of Oscar film received.
- Cut the 3rd column of every line and print it: `cut -f 3 oscars.tsv`
- Find 4: `cut -f 3 oscars.tsv | grep 4`
- Count how many of them: `cut -f 3 oscars.tsv | grep 4 | wc -l` (wc means word count, -l is for line)

## Wildcards

Wildcards is the star or asterisk that bash will replace with the name of all files in the current directory.

For example:
- `ls a*`: list all files start with "a".
- `ls *a`: list all files end with "a".
- `ls *ab*`: list all files contain "ab".
- `grep ab *`: search "ab" in all files.
- `echo *`: (echo is just simply echo what you type), bash will replace "*" with all the files in the directory.
- `mv *txt textFolder`: move all txt file to *textFolder*

## Superuser do

Some command that not allowed to run. To run it add `sudo` at the beginning.

## Customization

There are many files is used for customization. All these files should be placed at home directory.

**Bash**:
- .profile read on login -> should use for config variable
- .bashrc read for interactive shells -> should use for running commands, aliases

**Zsh**:
- .zshenv read always
- .zshrc read fir interactive shells

### Variables

`export SOMEVAR=some_value`

Usually to not set this everytime you start shell, you should put it in a `.zshenv` file. For **bash**, it is `.profile`.

```shell
$ nano .zshenv
$ export EDITOR=nano
```

**PATH** is a path variable indicate where to look for the commands. If it doesn't exist, shell will tell the command cannot be found.

To see the value, use `echo` and `$`.

```shell
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:
```

This means that when you use command like `grep` for e.g., the shell will go to `/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:` to find that command to execute.

Let's say we have *helloworld* program in *bin* folder. Using like this won't work:

```shell
$ helloworld
zsh: command not found: helloworld

$ bin/helloworld # path from the home directory to the executable file
# executes the file
Hello, World!
```

To make it easier, you can add *bin* to the PATH variable.

```shell
$ export PATH=$PATH:~/bin # extend the $PATH variable with bin, colon as separator

# now you can use helloworld from everywhere
$ helloworld
Hello, World!
```

### Aliases

In macOS, the `ls` list does not show any colors. To do it, you have to use `ls -G`.

Or you can simply put alias:

```shell
$ alias ls="ls -G"
$ ls
# show files in colors
```
