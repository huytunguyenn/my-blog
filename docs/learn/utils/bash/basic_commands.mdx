# Basic first

*You can use up arrow to go to previous command.*

If your system does not support up/down arrow key, you can use Ctrl-p or Ctrl-n.

`reset` to reset.

Ctrl-c to break off command.

### Read the docs

`man` for getting help. *E.g. `man ls` to see info about `ls` user commands.*

Then press `space` to move down, press `b` to move up. `/` for search, write the word then enter, `n` to find next occurs.

`q` to exit.

### Anatomy of a command

- Words seperated by spaces
  - First word: the command to run
  - Other words: arguments
- Options are arguments starting with -
  - It changes behavior of the command

Some for user interface:
- `Space bar` to move down, `b` to move up a page.
- `/` for search, `n` for next match.
- `q` for quit.

## Some commands

### Navigate filesystem

`pwd`: path to work directory.

`ls`: list contents. `ls -a`: list all files including hidden. `ls -l`: long format.

*`a` and `l` above called options. You can combine both by using `ls -a -l` or just `ls -la`.*

`cd somePathToDir`: change directory by go *somePathToDir*.

`cd`: go to home directory.

To get the suggestion when `cd`, use tab. E.g. in **bash**:

```shell
$ cd D# then hit tab twice
# shows all directories start with 'D'
Desktop/    Documents/  Downloads/

$ cd Doc# then tab
$ cd Documents/
```

With **zsh**, you only to tab once to show all suggestions, then continue to tab to choose the directory.

### Work with text files

`touch file1 file2`: create empty files.

*If you want space in filename, use single quote or backlash `\` escape*

`mkdir someDir`: create directory.

`rm someFile`: delete file permanently.

#### List files

`cat someFile`: show content of *someFile*. Use `less someFile` if the file is large & complex (then you can use `space` and `b` to move around, etc.).

`file someFile`: info of *someFile*.

`open someFile`: open a file (macOS).

#### Edit with Nano

`nano someFile`, it will show some instructions at bottom.

#### Edit with Vi

`vi someFile`.

**Vi** has different modes:
- Command mode *(default)*:
  - `X`: delete a character.
  - `DD`: delete whole line.
  - `:` *(shows `:` at the bottom*U, then do below before enter:
    - `w`: write (save file's changes).
    - `q`: exit **vi**. `q!`: exit without saving changes.
    - `wq`: write and exit.
- Insert mode:
  - Press `i` to enter this mode *(at the bottom shows `-- INSERT --`)*.
  - Press `esc` to exit this mode.

### Case sensitivity in filenames

Default filesystem on macOS is not case-sensitive.

Characters to avoid:
- Quotes: ` `` ' "`
- Brackets, parens: `{} () <> []`
- Interpunction: `! ? & | : ; \ ^`
- Other: `$ @ ~ * #`
- Whitespace: tab delete backspace newline

## Log in to another system using SSH

`ssh someLinuxServer`

**The prompt** will also change corresponding to the session.

`exit`, `logout`
