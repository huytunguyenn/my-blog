# Intro to shell

*Things you've done in shell could be permanent. There's no undelete or undo.*

## What is shell?

It runs programs by typing command. A **command line** is a text based UI.

**Bash** and **Zsh** (Z Shell) are popular shells. Bash is most popular, while Zsh is default on Mac since Catalina.

Other shells are: *sh, ksh, csh, tcsh, etc.*

Windows uses **cmd** & **Powershell**, but you can install Linux subsystems and run bash/zsh.

## Where are they?

Usually, you don't start the shell directly but run through a terminal emulator to help with fonts, colors, keystrokes, etc. (since shell is mostly limited to text).

The text you see when you start the shell is called **the prompt**. E.g.:

```shell
N9TJYJCTVY:~ tuhuynguyen$
```

Usually, it will show current username, hostname and working directory.

## Checking

Bash starts with `$`:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Bash terminal"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/bash-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/bash-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

While zsh starts with `%`:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Zsh terminal"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/zsh-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/zsh-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

To change you terminal type, go to `System Preferences > Users & Groups`. Then right-click on your user account > `Advanced Options`.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Users and groups"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/users-and-groups-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/users-and-groups-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Choose your prefer shell and click OK:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Advanced options"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/advanced-options-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/advanced-options-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
