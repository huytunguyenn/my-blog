# Intro

## Why use cloud functions?

Reduce maintenance: **Auto-scaling server** -> don't need to think about how much do I need. **Microservices**.

Secure code, faster deploy

Easy to integrate with services

## Intro to GGC Compute

### Compute Engine

VM (virtual machine).

### Kubernetes Engine

Container engine. An orchestration management tool.

### App Engine

Setting up server-side app that scales very well.

But it's not very good for making tiny services (because you will usually need instance of those services running -> cost a lot).

### Cloud Functions

This is fully managed environment, only charged for the time using (other three above always need VMs up and running)

## Running environment

Currently only support Nodejs LTS 6.11.1.
