# Intro

## Azure Functions

Sometimes, this referred to FaaS (Functions as a Service).

With this we just need to focus on writing application. Help with rapid & simple development.

> Azure Function = Events (Triggers) + Code

#### Differences with Azure Virtual Machine & Azure App Service

> Azure Virtual Machine is IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service).

-> Costly (server runs constantly), operational overhead (setup before running), patching & maintaining server, not auto-scaling.

> Azure App Service is PaaS (Platform as a Service).

-> **Azure Functions** is built on top of web jobs SDK & hosted on App Service platform.

### Events

Example:
- Time: run task on a regular schedule
- Data: process message in a queue, new items in blob storage
- Web: respond to HTTP request/web-hook

### Function App

Azure Functions group related functions together into a function app -> share configuration & local resources.
