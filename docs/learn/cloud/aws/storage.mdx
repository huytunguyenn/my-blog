# Storage

## S3

Use AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) for saving objects like *images, videos, files, etc*.

## DynamoDB

Use DynamoDB when you want to store the document or **key-value** pair data.

It doesnâ€™t work well for relational operations. Although it can be used for the storage of binary objects, it was designed for the storage of structured textual/JSON data.
