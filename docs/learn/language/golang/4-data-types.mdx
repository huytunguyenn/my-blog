# Data types

Data types in Go

## Declaration and primitives

There are many ways to declare a variable. Most basic three initializations are:
- explicit: declare the type + `var` or `const` syntax
- explicit inline
- implicit: using **`:=`**, compiler will declare the type for you <- **used most of the time**

```go
// explicit
var i int
i = 42

// explicit inline
var f float32 = 3.14

// implicit
someString := "Go is great!"
```

Some primitives:

```go
someString := "Go"
// -error
someString := 'Go' // error: more than one character in rune literal
someBool := true
someComplex := complex(3, 4)
someReal, someIm := real(someComplex), imag(someComplex) // split out complex number into its real & imaginary components

// highlight-start
(3 + 4i), complex number: số phức, i^2 = -1
> someComplex: (+3.000000e+000+4.000000e+000i)
> someReal: +3.000000e+000
> someIm: +4.000000e+000
// highlight-end
```


## Pointer

Pointer holds the address of a location in memory that holds the variable.

If you are not pointing the pointer to anything when declared, it will get error when assigned.

```go
var myName *string // not pointing to anything -> so it is <nil>

// -error
*myName = "huytu" // runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
```

Therefore, you will need to assign `new` for pointer when initialized. You can use `*` operator to reach though the pointer and grab the data back, this is call **de-referencing**.

```go
var myName *string = new(string) // not :=
*myName = "huytu"   // de-referencing


// highlight-start
> myName: 0xc000040250
> *myName: huytu
// highlight-end
```

### Address of a variable

```go
myName := "huytu"
ptr := &myName
// change value
myName = "zzzz"


// highlight-start
> ptr: 0xc000040250
> *ptr: huytu
after change value
> ptr: 0xc000040250
> *ptr: zzzz
// highlight-end
```

*You can see, I use `:=` for implicit declare, `=` for assign operator.*

## Constant

Constant is constant, it cannot be assigned after created. Therefore, we **use `=` instead of `:=`**.

```go
const pi = 3.1415
// -error
pi = 3 // cannot assign to pi (untyped float constant 3.1415)
```

### Implicit typed

Implicit syntax means compiler will interpret type as appropriate.

```go
// implicit
const c = 3 // not declare type, but it knows it's integer

// explicit
const c int = 3
```

Constant have to be **defined at compile time**. If you set up a constant expression and set it equal to the return value of a function, you will get an error.

```go
const c int = 3
res1 := c + 3
// -error
res2 := c + 1.2 // error: (untyped float constant) truncated to int


// highlight-start
> res1: 6
>
// highlight-end
```

To fix this, you will need to convert first.

```go
const c int = 3
res1 := c + 3
res2 := float32(c) + 1.2


// highlight-start
> res1: 6
> res2: 4.2
// highlight-end

// -error
res1 = float32(c) + 1.2 // warning: cannot use 'float32(c) + 1.2' (type float32) as the type int
```

Note that Go is a statically typed language, which means types of variables must be known at compile time, and you can't change their type at runtime.

:::tip

The standard naming convention is to **use PascalCase for constants**. E.g.: `MyConst` instead of `MY_CONST`.

### iota

Look at some examples here:

```go
const (
	first = iota
	second
)

const (
	third = iota
	fourth
)


// highlight-start
> first: 0
> second: 1
> third: 0
> fourth: 1
// highlight-end
```

And another example:

```go
const (
	first  = 1
	second = "second"
	three  = iota
	four   = iota
)

func main() {
	println(three, four)
	println(first, second)
	println(three, four)
}


// highlight-start
> 2 3
> 1 second
> 2 3
// highlight-end
```

*Can you guess how `iota` works?*

The `iota` keyword represents successive integer constants 0, 1, 2, ...:
- Increments *after each usage* (aka `const` specification)
- Resets to 0 whenever the word `const` appears

### constant expression

You can use many constant expressions with `iota` as well.

```go
const (
	first  = iota + 6
	second = 2 << iota
)


// highlight-start
> first: 6
> second: 4 (2 << 1)
// highlight-end
```

If you don't need to write `iota` expression on every line of constants, one on the first const means apply all for the rest.

```go
const (
	first = iota + 6
	second // shortcut for `second: iota + 6`
)

const (
	third = iota
)


// highlight-start
> first: 6
> second: 7
> third: 0
// highlight-end

// -error-start
const (
	first
	second = iota // error: missing value in the const declaration
	third
)
// -error-end
```

You can use the blank identifier `_` to skip a value in a list of constants.


```go
const (
    first = iota + 1
    _
    third
    fourth
)


// highlight-start
> first: 1
> third: 3
> fourth: 4
// highlight-end
```

Another common application for iota is to implement a **bitmask**, a small set of booleans, often called flags, represented by the bits in a single number. [Read more](https://yourbasic.org/golang/bitmask-flag-set-clear/)
