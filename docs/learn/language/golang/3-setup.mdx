# Install and configure

Download at [here](https://go.dev/dl) then install.

Check version:

```shell
$ go version

go version go1.19.1 windows/amd64
```

## Editor & organize source code

### Visual Studio Code

Install the `Go` plugin.

Hit `Ctrl(Cmd)+Shift+P`, the VSCode command window opened. Click on `Go: Install/Update Tools`. Select all the checkboxes showed up. Then click "OK".

### GoLand

**If you download the Go package after install GoLand, you have to configure `GOROOT`:**

Go to Settings (or `Ctrl+Alt+S`) > Go > GOROOT > Download the Go SDK.

**Configure GOPATH**

Settings > Go > GOPATH

It defaults to a directory named go inside your home directory:
- `$HOME/go` on Unix
- `$home/go` on Plan 9
- `%USERPROFILE%\go` (usually `C:\Users\YourName\go`) on Windows

**Run kind**

Click on Run bar > Edit configurations. At run kind, you can choose "File", "Directory" or "Package".

## Go command

### go mod init

Go module is a directory on hard drive that has a `go.mod` file. That file contains some configuration information about the module itself.

```shell
$ go mod init github.com/huytunguyenn/webservices
```

The first argument is the name of the module itself. When using `go get` command to retrieve dependencies, that information is used.

### go get

To include a package, we import it and Go automatically downloads it when we build or run the project. Or we can download it manually using the `go get` command.

```shell
$ go get github.com/huytunguyenn/webservices
```

```go
import (
    "github.com/huytunguyenn/webservices"
)
```

### go run

Run a file:

```shell
$ go run main.go
````

You can also run by the name that initialized in go.mod:

```shell
$ go run github.com/huytunguyenn/webservices
$ go run .
```

### go build

Create executable file.

## Simple demo

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello world")
}
```

A package is a collection of files which declare constants, types, variables and functions belonging to the package.

Each source file begins with a package clause defining the package to which it belongs

=> Constants, types, variables and functions belonging to a package are accessible in all files of that package.

The `package main` tells the Go compiler that the package should compile as an executable program instead of a shared library. The main function in the main package is the entry point of the program.

:::info
`fmt` stands for formatted I/O
:::

Result:

```shell
GOPATH=C:\Users\HUYTU\go #gosetup
C:\DEV_PROGRAMS\Go\bin\go.exe build -o E:\TEMP\GoLand\___go_build_main_go.exe D:\Desktop\learn-go\main.go #gosetup
E:\TEMP\GoLand\___go_build_main_go.exe
Hello world
```

You can give **aliases** to package:

```go
import (
     "fmt"
     str "strings"
)
```

```go
langs := []string{"F#", "Go", "Python", "Perl", "Erlang"}
s := str.Join(langs, ", ")
```
