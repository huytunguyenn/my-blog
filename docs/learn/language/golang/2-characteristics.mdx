# Overview

Some of Go characteristics. [golang.org](https://go.dev/)

**What's the problem?**

|   | C++                                                | Java                                | Python                                    |
|---|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| + | High performance <br/> Type safety                 | Rapid compilation <br/> Type safety | Ease of use                               |
| - | Slow compilation <br/> Historically complex syntax | Complicated ecosystem               | Lack of type safety <br/> Relatively slow |

=> GO:
- fast compilation
- fully compiled
- strongly typed
- concurrent *by default*
- garbage collected
- simplicity

## Characteristics

Go has a strong, static type system, better when compare to scripting languages such as JavaScript or Python.

Go is inspired by C's syntax.

Go is multi-paradigm programming language, a mixture of **procedural** and **object-oriented**.

Go is **garbage collected** language.

Go is fully compiled. Unlike *scripting languages* (which are interpreted at runtime) or languages that are compiled to some intermediate code that are interpreted by a runtime (such as Java)
- Go applications are fully compiled down to an executable binary -> highest levels of performance possible
- Single binary output -> simple deployment

Go has rapid compilation -> better when doing TDD methodology

## Philosophy and value

### Simplicity

For example:
- All loops in Go are **for-loops**
- Go doesn't make **expressions**, it is **statements** *(it evaluates all as 1 unit, whereas expression is a component of statement)*. For example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="code-1" label="There are some expressions">

    i := 1
    println(i++) // sometimes you may confuse
    println(++i)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="code-2" label="It's all statement">

    i := 1
    i++
    println(i) // 2, obviously
    i++
    println(i) // 3

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Network aware & concurrent apps

Unlike other languages, Go was created after CPUs have multiple core and were able to run tasks concurrently -> Go adotped those designs

- net and net/http packages: create web servers using only standard library
- goroutines: start tons of concurrent tasks with minimal resources
- channels: safely communicate between concurrent tasks

### Out-of-the-box experience

Standard library: string manipulation, data compression, file manipulation, networking APIS, testing, etc.

Go CLI: project initialization, build, code generation, retrieve dependencies, test, profiling, documentation, report language bugs,  etc.

### Cross-platform

Just by changing 2 parameters - GOOS and GOARCH, don't need any specified-platform device. For example:

|        | Windows | OS X   | Android |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| GOOS   | windows | darwin | android |
| GOARCH | amd64   | amd64  | arm     |
