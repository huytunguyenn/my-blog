## Working with JSON

### Serialize & Deserialize

The `jackson-databind` module provides several important classes and interfaces, including:
- `ObjectMapper`: The central class of the Jackson library that is used to convert between JSON and Java objects.
- `JsonNode`: Represents a JSON tree structure in memory, and can be used to manipulate JSON data programmatically.
- `JsonParser`: Parses JSON data from a source (such as a file or a string) and provides methods for reading individual tokens.
- `JsonGenerator`: Generates JSON data to a destination (such as a file or a string) and provides methods for writing individual tokens.

If a property of the object is null, it will not be included in the generated JSON string.
