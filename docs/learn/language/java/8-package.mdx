# Packages

Packages provide organization.

```java
package com.huytunguyenn.create;

public class Main {
}
```

Naming convention:
- all lowercase
- use reverse domain name notation to assure global uniqueness
- add further qualifiers to assure uniqueness within a company or group

Type names are qualified by their package, e.g. `com.huytunguyenn.create.Main`.

It also affects source code organization:
```bash
src
 |__com
     |__huytunguyenn
             |_______create
                       |____Main
```
