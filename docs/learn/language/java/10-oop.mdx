# Object-oriented Programming

4 main theoretical principles: abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.

## Abstraction

A lot of programming is about **types**.

A types can tell you:
- what the variable looks like (e.g. boolean is a simple flag)
- what you can do with that variable (e.g. you cannot )

Java has had primitives type already, and you can define new type with OOP (type == class). **Defining new types** and **creating objects out of them** is called abstraction.

## Encapsulation

**Hiding information** inside the class. It helps classes:
- easier to use: only care about interface, not the implementation
- harder to misuse: protect object from inconsistent changes
- easier to change: change the implementation without breaking clients

### Field Accessors & Mutators

You can hide information of class using [Access Modifier](/learn/language/java/9-classes-and-objects.mdx#access-modifier).

By making some members private, we split fields & methods into 2 groups:
- **interface**: public members, means it's visible from the outside to use
- **implementation**: private members, contains internal details, we can easily change implementation without affect interface

Usually, we want to make fields private (so it cannot be normally directly accessed), but if we need to expose that

$\rightarrow$ **getters & setters.**
