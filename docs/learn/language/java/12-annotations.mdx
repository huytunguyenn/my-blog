Annotations are special types that act as metadata:
- It has no direct affect on target behavior
- Annotation have to interpreted by things like tools (IntelliJ), execution environment (XML and JSON processors), any program
- Can be applied to a type or its members

Common Java core platform annotations:
- `@Override`: indicate we override an inherited method
- `@Deprecated`: indicate which method is no longer used
- `@SuppressWarnings`: tell compiler to not generate some kind of warnings (e.g. `@SuppressWarnings("deprecation")`)
